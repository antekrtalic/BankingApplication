Simple banking application where you have few options. You create acount by default, you just have to add your ID and name.
After you enter bank account you can check balance, withdraw, use deposit and check previous transaction. This program is pretty basic, but I'm going to improve it,
so other person can get a new card, where login to bank is check via card ID and pin.
